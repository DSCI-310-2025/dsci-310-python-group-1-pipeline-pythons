# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
​We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful environment for learning, teaching, and contributing. All participants in our group project and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.​

To clarify our expectations, everyone participating in our group project is required to adhere to this Code of Conduct. This Code applies to all project-related spaces, including, but not limited to, meetings, email communications, and online platforms such as GitHub. All project members are responsible for assisting with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.​

The project lead(s) are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. All reports of misconduct will be reviewed by the project lead(s) and will be kept confidential.

### Statement on  diversity and inclusivity 
In our data science group project, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive atmosphere where every member feels valued and respected. We believe that having diversity in all its forms—including race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, and cultural background—enhances creativity, innovation, and collaboration.

### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect
and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of
platform: either online or in-person.Some of the examples of behaviour that plays part in a positive environment for our group project members are:

- Focusing on what is best for the team members and the surrounding community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting different perspectives and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
- Engage authentically in all project activities, contributing to discussions, tasks, and collaborative efforts.
- Maintain a high standard of professionalism in all interactions, including adhering to agreed-upon deadlines, delivering quality work, and communicating effectively
-  Respect the privacy of all members by safeguarding personal information and project-related data, ensuring it is not disclosed without proper authorization

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors for participants in our group project include, but are not limited to:

- making written or verbal remarks that exclude or demean individuals based on their membership in any specific group
- using language that conveys threats of violence or directs violent intentions toward another person.
- engaging in actions that cause someone to fear for their safety, such as stalking, following, or intimidation.
- directing unsolicited sexual advances or attention toward another individual.
- initiating physical contact without the other person's consent
- persistently interrupting talks, events, or communications, hindering the project's collaborative environment.
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes

- sharing private communications or personal information without the individual's consent.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants are expected to immediately stop any inappropriate behavior upon request. This expectation applies across all platforms and events associated with our group project, whether online or in-person. Should a participant violate the Code of Conduct, the team may issue a warning and, if necessary, involve the DSCI 310 Instructor to investigate the violation and determine appropriate sanctions. Consequences may include temporary or permanent removal from the project, bans from the project's communication channels (e.g., GitHub issues, emails, private messaging applications), and, in cases of legal violations, reports to the appropriate authorities.
