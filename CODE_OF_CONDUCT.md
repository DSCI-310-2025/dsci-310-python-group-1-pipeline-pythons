Here we outline the standards of behavior expected from all team members, reinforcing a collaborative and ethical environment.​ A Code of Conduct (CoC) is critical for a respectful, inclusive, and professional environment within our data science group project.

1. Purpose

Our CoC aims to promote a positive environment where every member feels valued and respected, regardless of background or identity. It serves as a guideline for acceptable behavior and outlines procedures for addressing misconduct.​

2. Scope

This CoC applies to all participants of the project, including contributors, maintainers, and participants, both online and offline. It incorporates interactions in meetings, workshops, social media, and any other project-related events.​

3. Expected Behavior

- Treat everyone with respect, valuing diverse perspectives and experiences.​

- Engage in objective and constructive discussions, providing and accepting feedback gracefully, and working towards shared goals.​

- Abide by to ethical standards in data handling, analysis, and reporting. Ensure transparency and honesty in all project activities.​

4. Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment and Discrimination: Any form of harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior based on race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, or any other personal characteristic is prohibited.​

- Unprofessional Conduct: This includes inappropriate language, personal attacks, or any behavior that could be perceived as hostile or degrading.​

- Misuse of Data: Engaging in unethical practices such as data fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism is strictly forbidden.​


5. Reporting and Enforcement

Reporting Misconduct: If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the designated CoC enforcement officers. All reports will be handled confidentially.​

Consequences: Violations of the CoC may result in actions such as warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from the project, depending on the severity of the misconduct.​

6. Acknowledgment

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and understand that maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment is a collective responsibility.​

This CoC is inspired by established guidelines from organizations such as the Data Science Association and the Academic Data Science Alliance. ​
